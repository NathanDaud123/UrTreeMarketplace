## 🛡️ Security Best Practices

### For Developers

#### Authentication & Authorization
```typescript
// ✅ DO: Validate user on every protected route
const user = await validateUser(token);
if (!user) return unauthorized();

// ❌ DON'T: Trust client-side user data
```

#### Environment Variables
```bash
# ✅ DO: Use environment variables for secrets
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=xxx

# ❌ DON'T: Hardcode secrets
const apiKey = "hardcoded-key-123"; // NEVER DO THIS
```

#### Input Validation
```typescript
// ✅ DO: Validate and sanitize all inputs
const email = validateEmail(userInput);
const sanitized = sanitizeHTML(userContent);

// ❌ DON'T: Trust user input directly
```

#### Password Security
```typescript
// ✅ DO: Hash passwords
import bcrypt from 'bcrypt';
const hashedPassword = await bcrypt.hash(password, 10);

// ❌ DON'T: Store plain text passwords
const user = { password: "plain-text" }; // NEVER DO THIS
```

### For Deployment

#### HTTPS Only
- ✅ Always use HTTPS in production
- ✅ Enable HSTS headers
- ✅ Use secure cookies

#### CORS Configuration
```typescript
// ✅ DO: Restrict CORS to your domain
cors({
  origin: "https://yourdomain.com"
})

// ❌ DON'T: Allow all origins in production
cors({ origin: "*" }) // Only for development
```

#### Rate Limiting
```typescript
// ✅ DO: Implement rate limiting
app.use(rateLimiter({
  windowMs: 15 * 60 * 1000,
  max: 100
}));
```

#### Security Headers
```typescript
// ✅ DO: Set security headers
app.use((c, next) => {
  c.header('X-Frame-Options', 'DENY');
  c.header('X-Content-Type-Options', 'nosniff');
  c.header('X-XSS-Protection', '1; mode=block');
  c.header('Strict-Transport-Security', 'max-age=31536000');
  return next();
});
```

## 🔐 Security Checklist

### Before Production Deployment

- [ ] All secrets are in environment variables
- [ ] HTTPS is enabled
- [ ] CORS is properly configured
- [ ] Rate limiting is implemented
- [ ] Input validation on all forms
- [ ] SQL injection prevention
- [ ] XSS prevention
- [ ] CSRF protection
- [ ] Secure session management
- [ ] Error messages don't leak sensitive data
- [ ] Security headers are set
- [ ] Dependencies are updated
- [ ] Security audit completed
- [ ] Admin credentials changed
- [ ] Database backups configured

### Regular Maintenance

- [ ] Update dependencies monthly
- [ ] Review access logs weekly
- [ ] Rotate API keys quarterly
- [ ] Security audit annually
- [ ] Penetration testing (if required)

## 🚫 Known Security Limitations

### Current Implementation

⚠️ **Development/Prototype Status**
- Passwords are stored without hashing (for demo purposes)
- Rate limiting not implemented
- Email verification not enabled
- 2FA not available

### For Production

Before going to production, implement:
1. ✅ Password hashing (bcrypt/argon2)
2. ✅ Rate limiting on all endpoints
3. ✅ Email verification
4. ✅ 2FA for admin accounts
5. ✅ Session management
6. ✅ API key rotation
7. ✅ Audit logging
8. ✅ Intrusion detection

## 📋 Security Tools

### Recommended Tools

**Dependency Scanning**
```bash
npm audit
npm audit fix
```

**Code Analysis**
- ESLint Security Plugin
